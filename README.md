# Classifying Core Images from the Chixulub Impact Crater

[nice image of the core]

This repo contains notebooks that implement the hypercolumn 'Deep Feature'
core image classification scheme presented in my [SciPy 2020 talk]().

- Chicxulub background
- sparse labeling
- license and location of data
- training data, ilastik
- papers and references

This example uses core line scan image dataset made available by:

IODP Expedition 364 Scientists (2017): Line scan images of IODP Hole 364-M0077A. PANGAEA, https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.881718
